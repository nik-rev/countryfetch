# We use nightly Rust toolchain but set `rust-version` in `Cargo.toml` to
# a stable release.
#
# This allows us to use the latest versions of clippy, rustfmt and rust-analyzer.
#
# We can't use `#[feature(..)]` of course, and the `clippy::incompatible_msrv` lint ensures we
# don't use any Rust features that were stabilized in a later version than `rust-version` set
# in the `Cargo.toml`.
#
# We can use `#[feature(..)]` in tests which is nice - since tests aren't compiled with the main
# crate so MSRV does not apply to them
